# MultipleChoiceProgram
open source multiple choice program

this was made at the end of my first univeristy year to help classmates and i revise for a test. i also used it as an excuse to learn how to do GUIS in java. in future i would like to add in SQL databases, a quiz creation system and rather than using local files i ould like to connect it to a server.
